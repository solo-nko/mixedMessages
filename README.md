# Mixed Messages

## Why does this exist?
This is a portfolio project that I completed while progressing through Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer course.  It is meant to serve as practice in writing JavaScript, with a focus on arrays and array methods.

## What's it do?
It writes random sentences! Mixed Messages is a program that is designed to generate short sentences in English. It does so by pulling from pools of pre-designated words, represented as separate arrays.  

## Notable features
- Its selection logic is designed to only produce *grammatically correct* sentences, respecting article choice rules and subject-predicate structure.
- To keep sentences interesting, it will not use the same word twice in any one sentence, with the exception of articles.

## How to use
- Mixed Messages works at the console level. Loading it into a runtime environment such as Node.js should allow it to work.
